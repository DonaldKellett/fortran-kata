An individual side project for Codewars which ultimately aims to add GNU Fortran support to Codewars

## About this Repo

This repo was created with the sole purpose of bringing Fortran to [Codewars](https://codewars.com) and the final aim is to merge critical content in this Repo into the [Codewars Runner CLI](https://github.com/Codewars/codewars-runner-cli) at which point this repo will be archived.  However, please note that this project is **NOT** an official Codewars project and the author of this Repo is **NOT** employed at Codewars - he is merely a proud user of the Codewars service who wants to further improve it by contributing new content to the Codewars community.
